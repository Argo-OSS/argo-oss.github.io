(1 Mentor, 17 Mentees)Our Team met for participant to Open Source Contribution Academy.A competition for junior developers with the theme How can I contribute well to open source?This event is a competition where some mentors and about 20 mentees are paired up and the goal is to contribute together and achieve results for four months.We participated in this event on the open source topic of ArgoWorkflows.Most of us were afraid to even use git at first. but we made succeeded in making various contributions over the past three months.Let me introduce our achievements.","️-what-is-argoworkflows#☑️ What is ArgoWorkflows":"Before the achievements introduction, Lets know about what is ArgoWorkflows.\n\nArgo Workflows is a container-based workflow engine, an open source project that can run parallel jobs on Kubernetes.\nEach workflow step is defined as a container, and multi-step workflows can be modeled as a series of jobs, or dependencies between tasks can be executed using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).In other words, Argo Workflows makes it faster and easier to simple workflows tasks, as well as complex tasks for machine learning or data processing, on Kubernetes.\n\nArgo Workflows is a graduated project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).To become a graduated project, it must pass all tests conducted by the CNCF to meet their rigorous standards.\nBeing recognized as a graduated project means that Argo meets the highest standards for clear governance and committer processes, healthy growth, and security and compliance adherence.\nSince the rigorous standards, only about 13% of projects registered with the CNCF succeed in graduating.In fact, it took about 5 years for the Argo project to be recognized as a graduated project, with over 7,000 contributors, over 11,000 PRs, and over 370,000 contributions.Moreover, the Argo project is a very active and up-to-date open source, with over 2300 companies contributing to the code and over 8300 people contributing to the code.Argo Workflows is recognized as the most representative workflow engine in the cloud native community.Many companies around the world officially have introduced and used Argo Workflows. This is means that Argo Workflows can solve issues with workload in big companies.The following major companies are using Argo Workflows.\n\n... and over 200 other global companiesSome alternative tools to Argo Workflows include Apache Airflow, Tekton, and Prefect.Argo Workflows is a Kubernetes-native engine that makes it easy to orchestrate container-based workflows and manage resources.\nApache Airflow, similiar but different to Argo Workflows, is a standalone application and does not inherently utilize the capabilities of Kubernetes.\nAs a result, Airflow can more difficult to resource management and scalability than Argo Workflows.Also, Argo Workflows can perform a various of tasks such as CI/CD as well as data pipelines because it runs each workflow step as an independent container.\nThis is possible due to use the power of Container and Kubernetes, than it can run anything without restrictions.","️-key-accomplishments#☑️ Key Accomplishments":"","uiux-improvements#UI/UX improvements":"The Argo Workflows project is actively contributing to UI/UX improvement as the main topic for contribution.As proof of this, you can also check the dashboard for UI/UX improvement tracking.\n\nOur team has also made many UI improvements along these project goals.\nKey improvements for UI/UX\n\nSearch by name for WorkflowTemplates in UI\nshow history about completed runs in each cron workflow\nImprovements to DataPciker\nUI toolbar sticky\n... and Various other bug fixes","improving-core-functionality#Improving core functionality":"As contributions accumulate, our understanding of the project increased and we got more confidence.\nWe were increasingly able to contribute not only UI/UX improvements, but also the core functionality of the workflow engine.What’s new in Argo Workflows v3.5The core logic of the workflow engine is install as a CRD in Kubernetes and has a significant impact on the behavior and performance of a Kubernetes cluster.\nSo, Contributing to workflow engine is quite difficult.because it requires a high level of implementation and active participation in testing and policy discussions with maintainers.It was challenge for us, but our team was able to make key contributions to the Argo Workflows 3.5 release. Also We were mentioned to the Argo official blog by contributing very important features to Template Spec, Authentication, and Controller.\n\nEven after the release of Argo Workflows 3.5, we made many contributions such as CI and test environments for DX improvements, new features in the Nix, Controller, and Template specifications, updating GoLang version.\nWith more contributions, We are making progress in making Argo workflows a much better tool in next release.","close-communication-with-the-maintainer-group#Close communication with the maintainer group":"Our team was very fortunate that the Argo Workflows project got a new leader in May of this year, Yuan Tang, and the breath of contributions across the project really accelerated.Normally, in a large project like this, it would take quite a long time for reviews making it difficult to a lot of contributions.\nHowever, Thanks to the talented project head and his team, all of the ArgoWorkflows team members who participated in this competition learned a lot, experienced a lot,\nand grew through a lot of contributions in a short time.\n\nOpportunities for contributions existed outside Issue and PR pages.We were able to have the valuable experience of being in open source project, such as deciding on a policy for processing logic in the project to resolve issues and experiencing being assigned and working on other related issues.Now, We introduce our contributions during the project.","️-contribution-academy-progress-and-activity-details#☑️ Contribution Academy progress and activity details":"","from-not-knowing-anything-about-git-to-becoming-an-open-source-contributor#From not knowing anything about Git to becoming an open source contributor":"Of the 17 Masters stage participants, 12 of our team were made up of members who had no experience in proper collaboration/code review through GIT.As it is a CRD that runs on Kubernetes as an engine, it is a project that requires a high level of understanding of Kubernetes, but there were only 4 members with proper experience using Kubernetes.At first, I had no idea how to start and was at a loss, but as a result of practicing Git with a mentor and performing various tasks and studying in the practice REPO to become familiar with containers and Kubernetes, I gradually became familiar with the tool called Argo Workflows. It has begun.As a result, at the time of writing this report, we had the enjoyable experience of creating PRs for all 17 Masters stage participants.\n\n\nSummary of contribution activities\nAdditionally, contribution activities, which I had not been able to actively do at first because I was busy familiarizing myself with the tool and acquiring background knowledge, accelerated over time.In the end, the members' skills are growing so quickly that in September, in just the first week, they were able to match the number of PRs that were close to the PRs contributed during the previous month.\n\n\nMonthly Activity Graph\nIntroducing the various activities our team has performed to achieve the current contribution activities.","repository-creation-and-contribution-activities-to-practice-using-git#Repository creation and contribution activities to practice using Git":"Repository address: https://github.com/ArgoWorkflows-OSS/argoworkflows-oss.github.io\n\nGoal: Update member profile of issue template Select issue and create first PR according to issue content.\n\n\n\n- Goal Details\n- Edit/add the two files below to create a PR that updates user information.\n- `docs/users/users.md`\n- `docs/users/[name].md`\n- [How to link PR and issues using keywords](https://docs.github.com/ko/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue Please refer to #linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) to connect the issue and PR.

I must succeed this time'.\nI can still remember the promise I made to myself when I started, which made it all the more overwhelming and exciting.\nWhen I was applying for projects, I had to decide whether I wanted to work on something I knew or something new. I applied for a project related to devops, a field I hadn't been exposed to before, in order to educate myself and work harder.\nIt didn't take long for me to regret this decision. There was a lot to learn before I could even contribute, and a lot of time was wasted in building the basic environment of the project. However, when the development environment was built with other team members,\nsharing each other's difficulties every day and actively trying to help each other, it was an exciting time.\nErrors and bugs that occurred in my work always made me sensitive and annoyed, but in the academy, it was like a mission that I could do, and the process was fun like a game.\nNow that I'm writing this recap, I'm very proud of my contributions and I'm grateful to my colleagues and mentors who helped me along the way.\nIn the future, I will think about how I can apply the argo-workflow project to my work and actively contribute to the issues that arise. I would also like to contribute to new projects if there are other good projects.\nThank you.","-personal-summary-2#🌵 Personal Summary":"","4-subin-kim#4.

I don't think it can be compared to the person I am today, who didn't know much about the open source ecosystem in the early days of contribution. The reason I'm so satisfied First, we are smart team members.\nEvery week, there were many presentations on various topics, technologies used by people in the workplace, technologies of interest, etc. It was a premium lecture that could not be heard anywhere else, and it was a very helpful time. Second, we have reliable team members.\nAs someone with little development experience, I was a little scared of this contribution period. However, thanks to many people, including our leader mentee, Seongrak, who actively provided information when they posted questions on Slack, I was able to smoothly overcome the problems I experienced.\nThird, it is a comfortable meeting space and reliable support. We met every Sunday at the open-up space in Seocho. It was really clean, probably because it was a new building, and the coffee and snacks in the bathroom were just brilliant. Also,\nit was nice to be able to eat really delicious lamb skewers during the mid-day company dinner.Future plansThrough this year's contribution activities, I was able to clearly understand the open source ecosystem.

However, unlike other tools that support the common kubernetes ecosystem, the ability to reference Secrets was not supported.We started getting feature requests https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/issues/5506에서 for this, and we've implemented it and created a Draft PR.This feature was not easy to develop, especially since it required redefining things like the CustomResourceDefinition interface in Kubernetes, and figuring out the entire lifecycle of how a workflow is created, injected with sidecars, and created as a Pod.However, as we implemented the feature, we were able to gain a deeper understanding of how workflows are eventually transformed into pods and containers, and the logic behind how workflows templatize context and arguments internally.Create Issue` Incorrect creator labels on a resubmitted Workflow (link)\n\n\n\nArgo Workflow has a feature called Resubmit that recreates and runs a Workflow based on the same template. In the case of a resubmitted Workflow, the k8s object label related to the user who created the Workflow was not set based on the resubmitted user, but was set to the existing incorrect value.As a result, if the user who ran a workflow was different from the user who resubmitted the workflow, the workflow created by the resubmission would have an incorrect workflow creation user-related k8s object label.We raised an issue about this.Bugfix: fix: Apply the creator labels about the user who resubmitted a Workflow (link)\n\n\n\nWe created a Pull Request to resolve the issue (bug) we created earlier.We fixed the bug by labeling the correct Workflow constructor k8s object based on the resubmitted user information only, without considering the information of the existing Workflow executor when resubmitting.As an example of the change, we showed how a Workflow executed by a user named foo would be resubmitted by a user named bar, and how the creator-related label would be different if it was resubmitted by an unauthenticated user.We also found that there were a lot of other code that was impacted, so we wrote test code to make it more stable.Improvementsfeature: Propagate creator labels of a CronWorkflow to the Workflow to be scheduled (link)\n\n\n\nIf the CronWorkflow was created by a logged-in user, the CronWorkflow will be labeled with a k8s object for the constructor. However, there was an issue that the k8s object label would not be attached to Workflows that are created periodically based on the settings of CronWorkflow.Therefore, we have improved Workflows created with CronWorkflow to propagate CronWorfklow's constructor label.Issue.Insufficient logging in /oauth2/callback handler when using SSO Authentication (link)\n\nWe tried to activate the Authentication with Single Sign On (SSO) feature in Argo Workflows using the Identity Provider open source product called Keycloak, but we experienced a significant delay in the activation process due to the lack of logs.\nTherefore, we opened an issue on the topic of enhancing the logging of the feature activation operation.Feature.feature: Improve logging in the oauth2 callback handler (link)\n\nThis is the pull request that resolved the issue mentioned above (block link). We improved the feature to output error logs for each error case that occurs while using OAuth2 Protocol for SSO.Also, to make it easier for reviewers to review the pull request, we've added code verification to make the pull request more convincing.Study`docs: Add a user named Park Jinsoo (link)\n\nAt the beginning of the event, we practiced creating a pull request by adding an introduction about myself to the member profile of a repository that my mentor created for us to get acquainted with GitHub.","-participation-review-6#🌵 Participation Review":"It was a great opportunity for me to become a contributor to a well-known open source project after having been a user of many open source projects for my work and hobbies.With the help of my mentor, I was able to get started in open source contributing with Argo Workflow, overcome my fear of live video meetings between contributors, and develop the habit of reading code written by others.I'm now very interested in Argo Workflow, as well as other cloud-native, open source favorites like Argo Rollouts and Istio, and I've been communicating with contributors frequently via Slack.Before I started contributing to open source, I'm sure I would have been reluctant to do so.

Development container constructionPersonally, I set up the development environment by flying devcontainer myself. In fact, there were countless errors in the process, and I could imagine that other developers would come and squeeze their brains together if there was a bug in practice.I found out that when you solve dependency issues and later someone else makes an issue on my project, you use development containers to ensure you're working in the same environment,\nand I thought I'd have to use development containers in other projects I'm working on (discord bot-related projects).After the interim report, rather than changing my mind a little and feeling intimidated, I wanted to take the opportunity to overhear how other current employees operate the service in practice.\nIn fact, mentees presented various topics, and I was able to hear interesting topics such as load tests and explanations about ebpf in the company.

(Insufficient grounds to say to eliminate namespace - Other sites (Kubernetes Dashboard, OpenShift, Argo CD, etc.) also provide namespace without namespace)\n• Thoughts on whether it is possible to import and apply the logic used in continue and whether continue can be maintained as is even with custom results.\n• After analyzing the continue logic until Wednesday night, if it is concluded that pagination using continue is not possible, upload a question in the issue comment.\n• Front-end pagination (data is not reloaded, the method used in argocd) vs. server-side pagination (pagination after checking the entire list each time, will the load be okay?)\n• If server-side caching is implemented, is there a place to store it?\n2. I decided to do a full K8s search by applying only the namespace and label every time I turned the page.\n\n3. Additional logic implemented in offset-based pagination method\n• The part that didn't work\n• If you perform a filtered search after clicking the next page button, no data appears even if there are search results.\n• If you increase the number of pagination after clicking the next page button, the search results do not display properly.\n• What changed\n• As the continue value is updated on the server, when increasing the number of pages or applying filtering, there is a problem with pagination based on the continue value already set on the server.\n• A method of changing the continue value to be passed from the front was adopted ( When increasing the number of pages or applying filtering, set continue back to 0)\n\n\n4. Pagination Test\n• workflow_template_server_test.go passed\n• (14 workflow templates registered)\n• Normal : UI workflow template first page\n• Normal : when workflow template page limit is 5, 10, 50\n• Workflow template page Add workflow template on page 1 and move to page 2\n• Workflow template page Delete the workflow template from page 1 and move to page 2\n• Test the above with `name pattern` filtering search\n• Search without name pattern and then re-search by adding name pattern\n• After searching including the name pattern, deleting the name pattern and searching again\n\n5.

Cron workflow can not apply volumeClaimTemplates config from argo controller config map (workflowDefaults)Issue #11344\nPR #11662\nIssue Analysis\nTo understand this issue, I first needed to grasp what Default Workflows are.I learned that the workflowDefaults field in the argo workflows controller configmap allows you to set default values for workflows. Additionally, I discovered that if a workflow already has values for this field, those values take precedence.For example, after configuring the configmap as follows, when you create a Workflow,\n# This file describes the config settings available in the workflow controller configmap\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ConfigMap\nmetadata:\nname: workflow-controller-configmap\ndata:\n# Default values that will apply to all Workflows from this controller, unless overridden on the Workflow-level\nworkflowDefaults: |\nmetadata:\nannotations:\nargo: workflows\nlabels:\nfoo: bar\nspec:\nttlStrategy:\nsecondsAfterSuccess: 5\nparallelism: 3\nit will be automatically created with the values set in the workflowDefaults field, like this:\napiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1\nkind: Workflow\nmetadata:\ngenerateName: gc-ttl-\nannotations:\nargo: workflows\nlabels:\nfoo: bar\nspec:\nttlStrategy:\nsecondsAfterSuccess: 5 # Time to live after workflow is successful\nparallelism: 3\nThe issue was related to an error occurring when adding the volumeClaimTemplates value to workflowDefaults, causing errors when creating CronWorkflows or Workflows.The error message indicated, does not contain declared merge key: name.Upon checking the code, it was found that the error occurred in the StrategicMergePatch function, which is related to Kubernetes' patch strategy.\nVolumeClaimTemplates []apiv1.PersistentVolumeClaim `json:\"volumeClaimTemplates,omitempty\" patchStrategy:\"merge\" patchMergeKey:\"name\" protobuf:\"bytes,6,opt,name=volumeClaimTemplates\"`\nThe issue arose from the fact that the VolumeClaimTemplates type defined in Workflows used name as the patchMergeKey.However, upon inspecting the PersistentVolumeClaim type below, it was found that name was not present. In other words, the problem occurred because a value was defined as the patchMergeKey that was not part of the structure.\ntype PersistentVolumeClaim struct {\nmetav1.TypeMeta `json:\",inline\"`\n// Standard object's metadata.\n// More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata\n// +optional\nmetav1.ObjectMeta `json:\"metadata,omitempty\" protobuf:\"bytes,1,opt,name=metadata\"`\n\n// spec defines the desired characteristics of a volume requested by a pod author.\n// More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#persistentvolumeclaims\n// +optional\nSpec PersistentVolumeClaimSpec `json:\"spec,omitempty\" protobuf:\"bytes,2,opt,name=spec\"`\n\n// status represents the current information/status of a persistent volume claim.\n// Read-only.\n// More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#persistentvolumeclaims\n// +optional\nStatus PersistentVolumeClaimStatus `json:\"status,omitempty\" protobuf:\"bytes,3,opt,name=status\"`\n}\n\nIssue Resolution\nI removed the patchMergeKey from VolumeClaimTemplates.However, the reason patchMergeKey was added to VolumeClaimTemplates was to maintain consistency with conventions used for Volumes.Since this issue is related to policies, it indeed requires further discussion.This was my first PR to the ArgoWorkflows project, and it's great that i was able to identify the cause of an issue that was causing inconvenience for many people.2. Search by name for WorkflowTemplates in UIIssue #11004\nPR #11684\nIssue Analysis\nThis issue was worked on by a team of three people.\n\nWorkflowTemplates do not have a search function based on 'name', so to find a specific WorkflowTemplates, you could only search based on label.So, many users were feeling inconvenienced, and it was an issue related to 'feature improvement' that they would like to provide a function to search based on 'name'.\nIssue Resolution\n\n\nWe added additional logic to filter the results of WorkflowTemplates retrieved through the Kubernetes API based on their 'name', successfully implementing this feature.However, there was one issue.Existing pagination was implemented using Kubernetes' own continue value, so if Kubernetes results were custom manipulated like this, Kubernetes pagination could not be used.We had a lot of concerns about how to solve this, but We solved the problem by applying logic to implement cursor pagination using Kubernetes' resourceVersion.It was so fun to be able to discuss it with others instead of alone.I also felt good about providing some really needed functionality to the ArgoWorkflows project.3. A problem that is not initialized when changing the number of page limitsIssue #11702\nPR #11703\nIssue Analysis\nWhile resolving the Search by name for WorkflowTemplates in UI issue, i discovered a new pagination bug.When changing the number of pages, the continue value used for pagination was not initialized in the UI, so the data was not displayed properly.\nIssue Resolution\nI was able to solve the problem by simply modifying the logic to initialize offset when a change in page number is detected in the UI code.It was only a one-line code change, but this one line solved a problem that was quite inconvenient.4. Pagination may not work correctly for archived workflows\nIssue Analysis\nIssue #11715\nPR #11761This issue was directly communicated to us by Maintainer @terrytangyuan through Slack.\n\n\n\n\nIt felt like I was contacted by my favorite celebrity and I was so happy that I almost flew away. I suppressed my happy and excited heart and analyzed the issue.Workflows and ArchivedWorkflows were previously separated into different pages, but starting from the master version, Workflows and ArchivedWorkflows are combined into one page, and the logic has been modified to show ArchivedWorkflows together if they exist.However, when Workflows and ArchivedWorkflows were merged into one, a problem occurred with pagination.The two resources also used completely different pagination. Workflows was using the continue value, which is Kubernetes' own pagination, and ArchivedWorkflows used its own database, so it was using the database to perform pagination using the offset method.However, while passing the continue value used in Workflows to ArchivedWorkflows as is, a problem occurred where ArchivedWorkflows was not searched at all.\nIssue Resolution\nI was able to resolve the issue by referring to the pagination logic that was implemented while resolving the Search by name for WorkflowTemplates in UI issue.Since the two resources have no choice but to use different methods of pagination, rather than using pagination before merging the two resources, use a method of first searching the entire resource and merging the two resources and finally applying the pagination logic. I did it.I was able to solve the problem of ArchivedWorkflows not being searched, but fetching and merging the entire list every time the page is changed is a performance concern, so i'm thinking about a way to test performance.I plan to switch to front-end pagination if performance testing indicates that it's not working well.It was great to be able to solve a critical issue, and I felt proud and fun because I felt like I was contributing properly to the ArgoWorkflows project as a contributor.5. Relocation of Commit Guidelines Information in the DocumentationIssue #11700\nPR #11701\nIssue Analysis\nThe ArgoWorkflows project has a README document for developers attempting to contribute.However, it does not mention specific guidelines for commits.@GeunSam2 mentor mentioned that it was inconvenient when initially attempted to contribute and had difficulty finding commit guidelines.\nIssue Resolution\n\n\nUpon hearing this feedback, I made a modification to the contribution README by adding a link to commit guidelines.This change aims to make it easier for developers who want to contribute to ArgoWorkflows.In this PR, a maintainer provided a code suggestion, which was intriguing and enjoyable for me as I was encountering the code suggestion feature for the first time.","-participation-review-17#🌵 Participation Review":"If someone were to ask me what I did best this year, I would confidently say that it was my participation in the ArgoWorkflows project contribution activities.Meeting various developers in the same field, forming a sense of empathy, and engaging in discussions with them was truly enjoyable. Hearing stories about different companies was also quite interesting.During our weekly meetings, it wasn't just about working together; our mentors always conducted insightful seminars. Sundays became genuinely enjoyable, and time flew by.Meeting such capable mentors was a delight. I received advice on the concerns I had as a junior developer, my future direction, and how to study effectively as a developer, which made me happy.I always wanted to try contributing, but I was afraid to tackle such a big project. However, facing these challenges with such great mentees and mentors made my fears disappear.Submitting numerous PRs and communicating with maintainers was also a lot of fun, and it was really satisfying to see my code being incorporated.Thanks to this experience, I gained the confidence to contribute not only to ArgoWorkflows but also to other projects.I have no intention of stopping my contributions after this period ends. I plan to continue contributing to ArgoWorkflows while looking for opportunities to contribute to Kubernetes and Argo CD projects used by my company.","-personal-summary-16#🌵 Personal

활동하였습니다.오픈소스에 대한 진입장벽을 느끼는 주니어 개발자들과 선배 개발자가 함께 힘을 모아 컨트리뷰션을 하는 멋진 행사인\n오픈소스 컨트리뷰션 아카데미의 도움으로 팀이 구성되었으며, 2023년 07월 ~ 10월까지 약 4개월 간 활동하였습니다.Git 사용법이 익숙하지 않았던 걸음마 단계부터 시작해서, 어엿한 오픈소스 컨트리뷰터가 될 때까지 저희팀이 이룬 성과를 공유합니다.","️-argoworkflows-소개#☑️ ArgoWorkflows 소개":"Argo Workflows는 컨테이너를 기반으로 한 워크플로우 엔진으로, 병렬 작업을 쿠버네티스에서 실행할 수 있는 오픈소스 프로젝트입니다.\n각 워크플로우 단계가 컨테이너로 정의되며, 여러 단계의 워크플로우를 일련의 작업으로 모델링하거나, 작업 간의 종속성을 DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)를 사용하여 실행할 수 있습니다.즉, Argo Workflows를 사용하면 간단한 워크플로 형태의 작업 부터, 머신러닝 또는 데이터 처리를 위한 복잡한 작업 까지 쿠버네티스에서 더 빠르고 쉽게 수행할 수 있게 됩니다.\n\nArgo Workflows는 Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)에서 졸업에 성공한 프로젝트입니다.졸업 프로젝트가 되기 위해선 엄격한 표준을 충족하기 위해 CNCF가 실시하는 모든 테스트를 통과해야 합니다.\n즉, 졸업 프로젝트로 인정 받았다는 것은 Argo가 명확한 거버넌스 및 커미터 프로세스, 건전한 성장, 보안 및 컴플라이언스 준수에 대한 최고 수준을 충족한다는 것을 의미합니다.\n그 엄격한 기준으로 인해 CNCF에 등록된 프로젝트 중 졸업에 성공한 프로젝트는 약 13%에 불과합니다.실제로 Argo 프로젝트가 졸업 프로젝트로 인정 받기까지 약 5년이라는 기간동안 7000명이 넘는 컨트리뷰터와 11000개가 넘는 PR, 37만이 넘는 컨트리뷰션이 필요했습니다.뿐만 아니라, Argo 프로젝트는 현재에도 2300여개의 회사들이 코드에 기여하고 있고 8300여명이 코드에 컨트리뷰트 하고 있는 매우 활발하고 최신화된 오픈소스입니다.이로 인해 Argo Workflows는 클라우드 네이티브 커뮤니티에서 가장 대표적인 워크플로우 엔진으로 인정받고 있습니다.전 세계적으로 수 많은 기업들이 공식적으로 Argo Workflows를 도입해 사용하고 있습니다.\n이는 Argo Workflows가 큰 규모의 기업에서도 실제 작업 부하의 문제를 해결 할 수 있다는 강력한 증거입니다.Argo Workflows를 사용하는 대표적인 기업들은 다음과 같습니다.\n\n… 외 200개가 넘는 글로벌 기업들Argo Workflows와 비슷한 도구로는 Apache Airflow, Tekton, Prefect 등이 있습니다.Argo Workflows는 Kubernetes-native 엔진으로, 컨테이너 기반 워크플로우를 쉽게 조정하고 자원을 관리할 수 있습니다.\n이는 비슷한 도구인 Apache Airflow와 비교했을 때 주요한 차이점 중 하나로, Apache Airflow는 독립 실행 애플리케이션이며, Kubernetes의 기능을 본질적으로 활용하지 않습니다.\n따라서 Airflow는 자원 관리와 확장성이 Argo Workflows보다 더 어려울 수 있습니다.또한, Argo Workflows는 각 워크플로우 단계를 독립적인 컨테이너로 실행하기 때문에, 데이터 파이프라인 뿐만 아니라 CI/CD와 같은 다양한 작업을 수행할 수 있습니다.\n이는 Docker와 Kubernetes의 강력함을 활용하여 가능한 것이며, 이를 통해 제한 없이 어떤 것이든 실행할 수 있습니다.","️-주요-성과#☑️ 주요 성과":"","uiux-개선#UI/UX 개선":"Argo Workflows 프로젝트는 기여의 메인 키워드를 UI/UX개선으로 지정하고 따로 프로젝트 페이지를 운영하며 이슈들을 트레킹 할 정도로 해당 주제에 적극적인 기여를 진행하고 있습니다.\n\n저희 팀도 이러한 프로젝트의 목표를 따라 많은 UI 개선들을 수행했습니다.\n주요 개선 항목\n\nworkflows 검색 기능\ncronworkflows의 요약 view 개선\nDataPciker의 개선\nworkflows control패널의 sticky 옵션\nworkflows 목록의 label 강조 효과\n외 다양한 버그 개선","핵심-기능-개선#핵심 기능 개선":"컨트리뷰션 경험이 쌓이기 시작하면서 프로젝트에 대한 멤버들의 이해도가 올라가고, 자신감이 붙으면서 UI/UX에 관한 개선 뿐 아니라, 워크플로우 엔진의 코어한 기능에 대한 기여들도 점차 할 수 있게 었습니다.What’s new in Argo Workflows v3.5워크플로우 엔진의 핵심 로직은 쿠버네티스의 CRD로 설치되어 쿠버네티스 클러스터의 동작과 성능에도 크게 영향을 주는 만큼 구현 수준이 높고,\n각종 테스트 및 메인테이너들과의 정책에 관한 논의에도 적극적으로 참여할 수 있어야 기여가 가능한 만큼 컨트리뷰션 난이도도 굉장히 높은 기여에 속합니다.쉽지 않은 과정들이었지만, 저희 팀은 Argo Workflows 3.5버전의 릴리즈에 핵심적인 기여들을 해내는데 성공하며,\nTemplate Spec, Authentication, Controller 등의 매우 중요한 기능에 대한 기여를 Argo 공식 블로그에서 언급되며 기록을 남기기도 하였습니다.\n\nArgo Workflows의 3.5버전 릴리즈 이후에도, 계속하여 컨트리뷰터들의 DX개선을 위한 CI및 테스트 환경, Nix, Controller, Template 스펙의 새로운 피쳐 개발, Go Lang 버전 업데이트 등의 높은 난이도의 컨트리뷰션등을 이어나가고 있으며, 다음 릴리즈 배포에는 더욱 많은 기여로 Argo Workflows가 더욱 훌륭한 툴로 거듭나는데 의미있는 성과를 보태는 중입니다.","메인테이너-그룹과의-긴밀한-소통#메인테이너 그룹과의 긴밀한 소통":"저희 팀은 운이 매우 좋았습니다. Argo Workflows 프로젝트가 올해 5월에 Yuan Tang이라는 새로운 리더를 맞이하면서 프로젝트 전체의 컨트리뷰션 호흡이 매우 빨라졌다는 점입니다.보통 이런 대형 프로젝트에서는 리뷰에 상당히 오랜 시간이 걸려서 많은 컨트리뷰션을 해내기 어렵다고 생각하고 시작했었는데,\n능력있는 프로젝트 헤드와 그 팀원들 덕분에 이번 대회에 참가한 ArgoWorkflows 팀원들 모두 굉장히 많은 것들을 배우고 경험하며 짧은 시간 내에 많은 기여를 통해 성장할 수 있었습니다.\n\n기여를 이어나가다 보니, 워크플로우 엔진의 핵심적인 기능들에 대한 기여에 가까워질 수록, PR 페이지를 넘어서 CNCF슬랙을 통해 메인테이너 분들과 긴밀하게 소통하고 의견을 나눌 수 있는 상황들도 생겨났습니다.논의를 통해서 이슈를 해결하기 위해 프로젝트에서 로직을 처리하기 위한 정책을 결정하기도 하고, 연관된 다른 이슈를 할당받아 진행하는 경험을 하는 등, 오픈소스 프로젝트의 진정한 일원이 되어가는 소중한 경험을 해볼 수 있었습니다.프로젝트 기간동안 저희 팀이 기여한 작업물들을 소개합니다.","️-컨트리뷰션-아카데미-진행-과정과-활동-내역#☑️ 컨트리뷰션 아카데미 진행 과정과 활동 내역":"","git알못에서-오픈소스-컨트리뷰터가-될-때-까지#GIT알못에서 오픈소스 컨트리뷰터가 될 때 까지":"저희 팀은 마스터즈 단계 참가자 17명 중에서, 12명은 GIT을 통한 제대로 된 협업/코드리뷰 경험이 없는 멤버들로 구성이 되어 있었습니다.쿠버네티스를 엔진으로 삼고 동작하는 CRD인 만큼 쿠버네티스에 대한 높은 이해도가 필요한 프로젝트인데, 쿠버네티스를 제대로 써본 경험이 있는 멤버는 고작 4명에 불과 했습니다.처음에는 어떻게 시작해야할지 감도 안잡히고 막막했던 상황이었지만, 멘토와 함께 하는 GIT 연습 및 컨테이너, 쿠버네티스에 익숙해지기 위한 연습용 REPO에서의 다양한 과제 수행 및 스터디의 결과로 하나 둘씩 Argo Workflows라는 툴에 익숙해지기 시작했습니다.그러한 결과, 현재 보고서를 쓰는 시점에는 마스터즈 단계 참가자 17명 전원 PR을 생성해 보는 즐거운 경험을 해 볼 수 있었습니다.\n\n\n컨트리뷰션 활동 요약\n또한, 처음에는 툴에 익숙해고 배경 지식을 습득하는데 바빠 적극적으로 하지 못했던 컨트리뷰션 활동도 시간이 갈수록 가속도가 붙어서 9월에는 첫주차만에 지난달 한달 동안 기여한 PR에 가까운 갯수를 따라가게 될 정도로 멤버들의 실력이 빠르게 성장하고 있습니다.\n\n\n월별 활동 그래프\n저희 팀이 지금의 기여활동을 해내기까지 수행한 다양한 활동들을 소개합니다.","git-사용-연습을-위한-repo-생성-및-기여-활동-진행#GIT 사용 연습을 위한 REPO 생성 및 기여 활동 진행":"REPO주소 : https://github.com/ArgoWorkflows-OSS/argoworkflows-oss.github.io\n\n목표 : 이슈 템플릿의 멤버 프로필 업데이트 이슈를 선택하고, 이슈 내용에 따라 첫 PR을 생성.\n\n\n\n- 목표 상세\n- 아래 두개 파일을 수정/추가 해서 유저 정보를 업데이트 하는 PR을 생성해요.\n- `docs/users/users.md`\n- `docs/users/[이름].md`\n- [키워드를 활용한 PR과 이슈 연결 방법](https://docs.github.com/ko/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword)을 참고하여 이슈와 PR을 연결해주세요.

Resubmit된 Workflow의 경우 Workflow 생성 유저 관련 k8s object label이 Resubmit한 유저를 바탕으로 설정되는 것이 아니라 기존 잘못된 값으로 설정되는 버그가 존재했습니다.이로 인해 한 Workflow를 실행한 유저와 그 Workflow를 Resubmit한 유저가 다르면 Resubmit을 통해 생성된 Workflow에는 잘못된 Workflow 생성 유저 관련 k8s object label이 붙곤 했습니다.이에 대한 이슈를 제기했습니다.버그수정fix: Apply the creator labels about the user who resubmitted a Workflow (링크)\n\n\n\n앞서 생성했던 이슈(버그)를 해결하는 Pull Request를 작성했습니다.Resubmit 시에 기존 Workflow 실행자의 정보를 고려하지 않고 Resubmit한 유저 정보만을 바탕으로 올바른 Workflow 생성자 k8s object label을 달도록하여 버그를 수정했습니다.변경사항에 대한 예시로 foo라는 유저가 실행한 Workflow를 bar라는 유저가 Resubmit한 경우, 인증되지 않은 유저가 Resubmit한 경우 creator 관련 label이 어떻게 달리는지를 제시했습니다.또한 다른 코드에도 많은 영향을 끼친 부분이 존재해 이에 대한 테스트 코드도 작성해 안정성을 높였습니다.기능개선feat: Propagate creator labels of a CronWorkflow to the Workflow to be scheduled (링크)\n\n\n\n로그인한 유저가 CronWorkflow를 만든 경우 CronWorkflow에는 생성자에 대한 k8s object label이 붙게 됩니다. 하지만 CronWorkflow의 설정을 바탕으로 주기적으로 생성되는 Workflow에는 해당 k8s object label이 붙지 않게 되는 이슈가 존재했습니다.따라서 CronWorkflow로 생성되는 Workflow들이 CronWorfklow의 생성자 라벨을 그대로 전파받도록 개선했습니다.이슈생성Insufficient logging in /oauth2/callback handler when using SSO Authentication (링크)\n\nKeycloak이라는 Identity Provider 오픈소스 제품을 이용해 Argo Workflows에 SSO(Single Sign On)으로 인증 기능을 활성화하려했으나 이 과정에서 로그가 부족해 활성화 작업이 크게 지연된 것을 경험했습니다. 이에 해당 기능 활성화 작업에 대한 로깅 강화를 주제로한 이슈로 열었습니다.기능개선feat: Improve logging in the oauth2 callback handler (링크)\n\n위에서 언급한 이슈(블록 링크)를 해결한 Pull Request입니다. SSO를 위해 OAuth2 Protocol을 이용하는 과정에서 발생하는 에러 케이스별로 에러 로그를 출력하도록 기능을 개선했습니다.또한 Pull Request의 Reviewer가 좀 더 편하게 리뷰할 수 있도록, Pull Request가 설득력을 갖도록, 변경사항을 검증할 수 있는 Verification을 코드로 나타냈습니다.공부docs: Add a user named 박진수 (링크)\n\n행사를 시작하면서 멘토님께서 GitHub에과 친해질 수 있도록 만들어주는 레포지토리의 멤버 프로필에 저에 대한 소개를 추가해 Pull Request를 생성해보는 실습을 진행했습니다.","-참가-후기-6#🌵 참가 후기":"그동안 수많은 오픈소스를 활용해 업무를 하고 취미생활을 하면서도 단순히 사용자로서만 남아있었던 제가 유명 오픈소스의 컨트리뷰터가 될 수 있었던 좋은 기회였습니다.멘토님의 도움으로 Argo Workflow를 통해 오픈소스 컨트리뷰션 활동에 입문할 수 있었고, 컨트리뷰터 간의 실시간 화상 미팅의 두려움도 극복할 수 있었으며, 다른 사람이 작성한 코드도 거부감 없이 읽어보는 습관을 기를 수 있었습니다.저는 지금 Argo Workflow뿐만 아니라 Argo Rollouts, Istio 등 클라우드 네이티브한 환경에서 많이 사랑받고 있는 오픈소스에도 많은 관심을 갖고 있으며 Slack을 통해 컨트리뷰터들과 자주 소통해오고 있습니다.오픈소스 컨트리뷰션을 진행하기 전의 저였다면 이러한 소통 조차도 꺼렸을 것이 분명합니다. 하지만 이제는 이런 소통에 전혀 부담이 없고 앞으로는 Argo Workflow에서 제가 기여했던 것처럼 Argo Rollouts와 Istio에도 많은 기여를 해보고자 합니다!지난 기간동안 힘써주신 주최측과 멘토님께 감사의 인사를 전합니다. 감사합니다.","-기여-요약-5#🌵 기여 요약":"","7-서청운#7. 서청운":"","-개인-성과-보고-6#🌿 개인 성과 보고":"접기/펼치기\n\n개인 성과\nPR 1개 Open\n\n\n컨트리뷰션 준비 과정\nOSSCA 사무국이 공유해주신 기본 Git 전략에 대한 공유 영상을 확인하고, 놓치고 있는 새로운 부분과 기존의 알고있던 개념을 결합시켜 Git에 대한 이해와 응용도를 높였습니다.\n팀에서 진행하는 ArgoWorkflows-OSS/ArgoWorkflows-OSS 레포지토리에서 오픈소스 컨트리뷰트를 위해 필수적으로 알아야할 개념(gpg private key)와 issues, PR title 등을 실제로 미션을 수행하며 경험적으로 체득할 수 있도록 했습니다.\ndevcontainer를 사용해 Argo Workflow의 로컬 개발환경을 직접 구축하고 테스트해보며 실제로 컨트리뷰트를 하기위한 필수조건을 테스트해봤습니다. 여러 라이브러리 종속성에 대한 이식성이 좋은 도구여서 매우 사용하기 편리했습니다.\n\n\n컨트리뷰션 진행 내용\n공식 docs의 fields 예제 수정\nhttps://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/11748\n기존 공식문서에서 크론워크플로우를 사용하지 않는 문서 예제가 CronWorkflowSpec , CronWorkflowStatus 필드에 포함되어 있어 필요한 데이터를 찾는 데 혼란을 불러왔었습니다.\n그래서 필요한 자료를 찾기 위해 CronWorkflowSpec , CronWorkflowStatus 필드의 예제에서는 크론워크플로우를 사용하는 예제만 허용하도록 했습니다.","-참가-후기-7#🌵 참가 후기":"프로그램 참가 후기\n오픈소스 생태계를 이렇게 심도있게 알아가고, 이해할 수 있는 모임이 또 있을까 라는 생각이 들 정도로 멘토님과 멘티분들이 훌륭하고 또 정말 열심히 모임을 이끌어 주셨습니다.\n개인으로서는 아쉬움이 무척 크기도 했습니다. 조금 더 시간을 투자하고 적극적으로 모임에 참여해서 개인의 성장 뿐만 아니라 더 좋은 모임으로 만들 수 있었을 텐데, 여러 외부 요인과 스스로의 게으름 때문에 아쉬움을 많이 남겼던 기간이었습니다.\n\n\n향후 기여 계획\n더 이상 오픈소스 컨트리뷰트가 무서운(?) 일이 아니라는 큰 자신감을 얻어서, 이후에도 Argo 생태계를 넘어 CNCF 생태계에도 더욱 관심을 가지고 오픈소스를 탐험할 수 있을 것 같습니다.\n처음부터 소스를 다 까보지 않고도 이전 PR 기록, 메인테이너의 도움을 통해 기여를 할 수 있음을 토대로 컨트리뷰트에 대한 심리적인 허들을 넘어 적극적으로 기여를 이어갈 계획입니다.","-기여-요약-6#🌵 기여 요약":"","8-송혜민#8. 송혜민":"","-개인-성과-보고-7#🌿 개인 성과 보고":"접기/펼치기\n\n컨트리뷰션 활동\nMutex check happens after memoization cache check and lock info missing from UI버그수정Issue #11219\nPR #11456 -

Argo Workflow의 어떤 부분은 페이지네이션이 되어있고, 어떤 부분은 되어있지 않으며, 또 어떤 부분은 제목은 나와 있지 않은, 한마디로 UI 내의 일관성 깨짐 문제를 발견하셨고, 이를 해결하고자 이슈 해커톤에서 팀원을 구해 기여하시는 모습이 인상깊었습니다.뭔가 제가 기여할 부분을 찾을 때는 로직 관련 이슈를 찾으려 했으나, 너무 어렵고 이게 대체 어떻게 돌아가는지 파악이 안됐는데, 저렇게 기여를 할 수 있구나…라는 생각이 들어 생각보다 기여에 그렇게 큰 겁을 먹지 않아도 된다는 생각이 들었습니다.멘토님을 포함한 다른 모든 분이 현직자이시며 정말 실력이 대단하신 만큼, 저도 모임에 가며 많은 것을 알아갔습니다. 워크플로우가 실무 내에서는 어떻게 쓰이고 있는지, 특히 제가 요즘 공부하고 있는, 정말 만능처럼 보이는 Airflow가 왜 실무 내에서는 그닥 그렇게 많이 쓰이고 있지는 않은지에 대한 이유 등 이론과 실무의 차이들을 볼 수 있었습니다.솔직히 오픈소스 컨트리뷰션에 참가한 만큼, 저도 이슈에 하나 정도는 기여하고 싶은 욕심이 있습니다. 남은 기간이 별로 안남은 만큼, 활동이 끝나기 전까지 아주 자잘한 이슈 하나 정도라도 기여하는 것이 우선 제 계획이며, 이제 개강이 기다리고 있는데, 개강을 해도 정기모임에 나가서 배울 수 있는 것은 최대한 배우는 시간을 가지고 싶습니다.","-기여-요약-9#🌵 기여 요약":"","11-유윤우#11. 유윤우":"","-개인-성과-보고-10#🌿 개인 성과 보고":"접기/펼치기\n1. 왕초보반 dockerfile 만들어보기\n\n\n\n나만의 웹 서비스를 만들고 도커파일을 통해 이미지를 빌드하고 컨테이너를 실행해보는 실습 진행\n각자 원하는 프레임워크와 언어를 통해 서비스를 구축, 저는 Nest.js를 사용했습니다.\n\n2.

Cron workflow can not apply volumeClaimTemplates config from argo controller config map (workflowDefaults)Issue #11344\nPR #11662\n이슈 분석\n이 이슈를 이해하기 위해서는 먼저 Default Workflows가 무엇인지를 알아야 했습니다.argo workflows controller configmap에 workflowDefaults 라는 필드는 넣어 워크플로에 대한 기본값을 설정할 수 있으며, 워크플로에 이미 해당 필드값이 있을 경우에는 워크플로 값이 우선된다는 것을 알게되었습니다.예를 들어 configmap을 다음과 같이 설정한 뒤에 Workflows를 생성하면\n# This file describes the config settings available in the workflow controller configmap\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ConfigMap\nmetadata:\nname: workflow-controller-configmap\ndata:\n# Default values that will apply to all Workflows from this controller, unless overridden on the Workflow-level\nworkflowDefaults: |\nmetadata:\nannotations:\nargo: workflows\nlabels:\nfoo: bar\nspec:\nttlStrategy:\nsecondsAfterSuccess: 5\nparallelism: 3\n자동으로 workflowDefaults 필드에 설정해준 대로 Workflows가 아래와 같이 생성됩니다.\napiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1\nkind: Workflow\nmetadata:\ngenerateName: gc-ttl-\nannotations:\nargo: workflows\nlabels:\nfoo: bar\nspec:\nttlStrategy:\nsecondsAfterSuccess: 5 # Time to live after workflow is successful\nparallelism: 3\n해당 이슈는 workflowDefaults에 volumeClaimTemplates 값을 넣으면, CronWorflows/Workflows 생성 시 에러가 발생한다는 이슈였습니다.does not contain declared merge key: name 라는 에러메세지가 발생하는 것을 확인했습니다.코드를 확인해보니 StrategicMergePatch 함수에서 에러가 발생했고 이는 쿠버네티스의 patch 전략과 관계가 있었습니다.\nVolumeClaimTemplates []apiv1.PersistentVolumeClaim `json:\"volumeClaimTemplates,omitempty\" patchStrategy:\"merge\" patchMergeKey:\"name\" protobuf:\"bytes,6,opt,name=volumeClaimTemplates\"`\nWorkflows에서 정의되어있는 타입인 VolumeClaimTemplates는 patchMergeKey로 name을 사용하도록 정의되어있었습니다.그러나 아래 PersistentVolumeClaim타입을 확인해보면 name은 존재하지 않습니다. 즉, 구조체에 정의되어있지 않은 값을 patchMergeKey로 정의해두어서 발생하는 문제였습니다.\ntype PersistentVolumeClaim struct {\nmetav1.TypeMeta `json:\",inline\"`\n// Standard object's metadata.\n// More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata\n// +optional\nmetav1.ObjectMeta `json:\"metadata,omitempty\" protobuf:\"bytes,1,opt,name=metadata\"`\n\n// spec defines the desired characteristics of a volume requested by a pod author.\n// More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#persistentvolumeclaims\n// +optional\nSpec PersistentVolumeClaimSpec `json:\"spec,omitempty\" protobuf:\"bytes,2,opt,name=spec\"`\n\n// status represents the current information/status of a persistent volume claim.\n// Read-only.\n// More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#persistentvolumeclaims\n// +optional\nStatus PersistentVolumeClaimStatus `json:\"status,omitempty\" protobuf:\"bytes,3,opt,name=status\"`\n}\n\n이슈 해결\nVolumeClaimTemplates에서 patchMergeKey를 제거하도록 해당 이슈를 수정하였습니다.그러나 VolumeClaimTemplates에 patchMergeKey가 붙은 이유는 Volume과 같은 컨벤션을 사용하고 있어서 였습니다.해당 이슈는 이처럼 정책과 관련되어있기 때문에 더 많은 의논이 필요한 상황입니다.ArgoWorkflows 프로젝트에 처음으로 올린 PR이었고 꽤나 많은 사람들이 불편해하고 있는 이슈의 원인을 찾아낼 수 있어서 기뻤습니다.2. Search by name for WorkflowTemplates in UIIssue #11004\nPR #11684\n이슈 분석\n이번 이슈는 3명으로 팀을 짜서 작업을 진행했습니다.\n\nWorkflowTemplates는 '이름'을 기준으로 검색하는 기능이 존재하지 않아 특정 WorkflowTemplates을 찾기 위해서는 label을 기준으로만 찾을 수 있었습니다.그래서 많은 사용자들은 불편함을 느끼고 있었으며 '이름'을 기준으로 찾을 수 있는 기능을 제공해줬으면 좋겠다는 '기능 개선' 관련 이슈였습니다.\n이슈 해결\n\n\n쿠버네티스 API를 통해 조회된 WorkflowTemplates의 결과를 '이름'을 기준으로 필터링하는 로직을 추가적으로 넣어 해당 기능을 구현하였습니다.그러나 한가지 이슈가 존재했습니다.기존 페이지네이션은 쿠버네티스 자체 continue 값을 이용해 구현되어있어서 쿠버네티스 결과를 이처럼 커스텀하게 조작할 경우 쿠버네티스 페이지네이션을 사용할 수 없었습니다.이를 어떻게 해결해야 할까 고민이 많았지만 쿠버네티스의 resourceVersion을 이용하여 커서 페이지네이션을 하도록 구현하는 로직을 적용함으로써 해당 문제를 해결하였습니다.혼자가 아니라 여럿이 의논하며 할 수 있어서 너무 재미있었습니다.또한 ArgoWorkflows 프로젝트에 정말 필요한 기능을 제공했다고 생각하여 기분이 좋았습니다.3. A problem that is not initialized when changing the number of page limitsIssue #11702\nPR #11703\n이슈 분석\nSearch by name for WorkflowTemplates in UI 이슈를 해결하면서 새로운 페이지네이션 버그를 발견하였습니다.페이지 갯수를 변경할 때 페이지네이션을 위해 사용하는 continue 값을 UI에서 초기화 시켜주지 않아서 데이터가 제대로 보이지 않는 문제였습니다.\n이슈 해결\nUI 코드에서 페이지 갯수 변경이 감지될 때 offset을 초기화 하도록 간단하게 로직을 수정하여 문제를 해결할 수 있었습니다.단 한줄의 코드 수정이었으나 이 한 줄로 인해 꽤나 불편함을 주었던 문제를 해결할 수 있었습니다.4. Pagination may not work correctly for archived workflows\n이슈 분석\nIssue #11715\nPR #11761Maintainer @terrytangyuan 님께서 직접 Slack으로 연락을 주신 이슈입니다.\n\n\n\n\n좋아하는 연예인에게 연락받은 기분이라 너무 기분이 좋아서 날아갈 뻔 했습니다. 기쁘고 들뜨는 마음을 누르고 이슈를 분석해보았습니다.Workflows와 ArchivedWorkflows가 이전에는 다른 페이지로 분리되어있었지만 master 버전부터 Workflows와 ArchivedWorkflows를 하나의 페이지로 합치고 ArchivedWorkflows가 존재한다면 같이 보여주도록 로직이 수정되었습니다.그러나 Workflows와 ArchivedWorkflows가 하나로 합쳐지면서 페이지네이션에서 문제가 발생했습니다.두 개의 리소스는 서로 전혀 다른 페이지네이션을 사용하도 있었습니다. Workflows는 쿠버네티스 자체 페이지네이션인 continue값을 사용하고 있었고, ArchivedWorkflows는 자체적으로 데이터베이스를 사용하기 때문에 데이터베이스를 이용하여 offset 방식으로 페이지네이션을 하고 있었습니다.그러나 ArchivedWorkflows에 Workflows에서 사용하는 continue값을 그대로 전달하면서 ArchivedWorkflows가 아예 조회되지 않는 문제가 발생했습니다.\n이슈 해결\nSearch by name for WorkflowTemplates in UI 이슈를 해결하면서 구현했던 페이지네이션 로직을 참고하여 해당 이슈를 해결할 수 있었습니다.두 리소스는 다른 방법의 페이지네이션을 사용할 수 밖에 없기 때문에 두 개의 리소스를 합치기 전에 페이지네이션을 사용하는 것이 아닌, 일단 전체 리소스를 조회하여 두 리소스를 합친 후에 마지막으로 페이지네이션 로직을 적용하는 방법을 사용하였습니다.ArchivedWorkflows가 조회되지 않는 문제를 해결할 수 있었으나 페이지를 변경할 때마다 전체 리스트를 가져와 합치기까지 하는 것이 성능상 걱정이 되는 부분이라 성능 테스트를 할 수 있는 방법을 고민해볼 생각입니다.성능테스트를 해본 뒤 아니다싶으면 프론트에서 페이지네이션을 하는 방식으로 변경해볼 생각입니다.크리티컬한 이슈를 해결할 수 있어서 너무 좋았고 ArgoWorkflows 프로젝트에 컨트리뷰터로써 제대로 기여를 하고 있다는 생각이 들어 뿌듯하고 재밌었습니다.5. Relocation of Commit Guidelines Information in the DocumentationIssue #11700\nPR #11701\n이슈 분석\nArgoWorkflows 프로젝트에는 컨트리뷰션을 시도하는 개발자들을 위한 리드미 문서가 있습니다.하지만 그곳에는 커밋에 관한 가이드라인이 따로 언급되어있지 않습니다.GeunSam2 멘토님께서 본인이 처음 기여를 시도하려고 했을 때 커밋에 대한 가이드라인을 찾는데 너무 오래 걸려서 불편했다고 말해주셨습니다.\n이슈 해결\n\n\n이 불편사항을 들은 후 컨트리뷰션 리드미에 커밋에 대한 가이드라인의 링크를 걸어주도록 수정함으로써 ArgoWorkflows에 기여하고자 하는 개발자들이 편하게 기여할 수 있도록 하였습니다.이 PR에서는 메인테이너가 코드 제안을 해주었는데 코드 제안 기능을 처음 접해보아서 흥미롭고 재밌었습니다.","-참가-후기-17#🌵 참가 후기":"이번년도에 가장 잘 한 일이 무엇인지 묻는다면, 아무 망설임도 없이 ArgoWorkflows 프로젝트 컨트리뷰션 활동에 참여한 것이라고 이야기 할 것입니다.같은 분야에 있는 다양한 개발자들을 만나서 서로 공감대를 형성하며 이야기하는 것이 너무 좋았고 다양한 회사에 대한 이야기를 듣는것이 참 재밌었습니다.매주 모임마다 그저 모각코를 하는 것이 아니라 멘티들과 멘토님이 매번 좋은 세미나를 진행해주셔서 매주 일요일이 참 즐겁고 시간이 빨리갔습니다.또한 너무 능력있는 멘토님을 만나 평소에 주니어 개발자로서 고민되었던 부분, 앞으로의 방향성, 개발자로서 잘 공부하는 방법에 대한 조언들을 들을 수 있어서 행복했습니다.평소 컨트리뷰션에 도전해보고싶었지만, 이런 큰 프로젝트에 어떻게 기여를 하나 두려워서 시도하지 않았던 부분들을 이렇게 좋은 멘티들과 멘토님과 같이 부딪혀보니 두려움이 사라졌습니다.많은 PR을 올려보면서 메인테이너들과 소통하는 것도 너무 재미있었고 실제 나의 코드가 반영되는 것을 지켜보는게 정말 뿌듯했습니다.이번 경험으로 인해 ArgoWorkflows 뿐만 아니라 다른 프로젝트에도 충분히 기여할 수 있겠다는 자신감이 생겼습니다.이 기간이 끝난다고 컨트리뷰션을 멈출 생각은 없습니다. 앞으로도 ArgoWorkflows를 꾸준히 보면서 기여하고 싶은 부분에 기여할 생각입니다. 또한 ArgoWorkflows 뿐만 아니라 회사에서 사용하는 Kubernetes나 Argo CD 프로젝트에도 기여해보고 싶어서 도전해볼 생각입니다.","-기여-요약-16#🌵 기여 요약":""}},"/2023/members":{"title":"Members","data":{"":"","멤버-목록#멤버 목록":"염근철(멘토)\n\n\n강병선\n강시온\n권영길\n김수빈\n김원식\n김학준\n박진수\n서청운\n송혜민\n안다혜\n안지완\n유윤우\n이병곤\n이의주\n전의정\n정성락\n채문영\n최수녕"}},"/2023/members/AhnDaHae":{"title":"Ahndahae","data":{"":"name : 안다혜\ngithub : da.head0\nage : 미상 ^.^\nblog : aimb\ntwitter : MM (비팔알림이 꺼져 있어서 팔로하시면 댓글이나 메시지 한번만 주세요...)\n\n2023 오픈소스 컨트리뷰션 아카데미의 ArgoWorkflows 프로젝트에 멘티로 참여하게 되었습니다.\n현재 SRE로 일하고 있습니다.\n2022년의 스터디봇입니다. 사실 2023년도 스터디봇으로 살고 있긴 합니다.\n치즈 조랭이떡 고양이를 키웁니다.\n키보드 좋아합니다. 같이 윤활하실분 항시 환영..."}},"/2023/members/AhnJiWan":{"title":"Ahnjiwan","data":{"":"name : 안지완\ngithub : synoti21\nage : 22\nblog : velog\n\n데이터 엔지니어링 중 파이프라인 CI/CD 배포에서 사용되는 k8s에 관심을 갖게되어 들이파게 됐고, k8s 기반 워크플로우인 argo workflow를 경험해보고자 OSS에 지원하게 되었습니다.MLOps 관련 발제 때문에 한 주간 너무 정신없어서 이제서야 올리네요ㅠㅠ다른 참가자분들에 비해 너무 부족해서 주눅드는 감이 없진 않지만 그래도 정말 열심히 참여하겠습니다."}},"/2023/members/ChaeMoonYoung":{"title":"Chaemoonyoung","data":{"":"name : 채문영\ngithub : mmonyoungCHAE\nage : 만 26살\nblog : Velog\n\n2023 오픈소스 컨트리뷰션 아카데미의 ArgoWorkflows 프로젝트에 멘티로 참여하게 되었다.\n클라우드 서비스 백엔드 개발자입니다.\n운동 좋아해요!
