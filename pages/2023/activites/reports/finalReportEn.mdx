## ☑️ Meet Our Team

The ArgoWorkflows OSS 2023 team consisted of one mentor and 17 mentees, for a total of 18 people working as a team.

The team was organized with the help of the [Open Source Contribution Academy](https://www.contribution.ac/2023-ossca), an awesome event that **brings together junior and senior developers** who may feel intimidated by open source to contribute, and was active for about **4 months from July to October 2023.**

Starting from our humble beginnings with Git to becoming accomplished open source contributors.

Here's a look at what our team accomplished.

## ☑️ What is ArgoWorkflows

![argoDag](./images/common/argoDag.png)

Argo Workflows is a container-based workflow engine, an open source project that allows you to run parallel jobs on Kubernetes. Each workflow step is defined as a container, and multi-step workflows can be modeled as a series of tasks, or dependencies between tasks can be executed using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

In short, Argo Workflows makes it faster and easier to perform tasks in the form of simple workflows, as well as complex tasks for machine learning or data processing, on Kubernetes.

![argo_0](./images/common/argo_0.png)

Argo Workflows is a graduated project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

To become a graduated project, you must pass all of the tests that the CNCF conducts to meet their rigorous standards. This means that being recognized as a graduated project means that Argo meets the highest standards for clear governance and committer processes, healthy growth, and security and compliance adherence. Because of the rigorous standards, only about 13% of projects registered with the CNCF succeed in graduating.

In fact, it took the Argo project over 7000 contributors, over 11,000 PRs, and over 370,000 contributions over a period of about 5 years to be recognized as a graduating project.

Not only that, but the Argo project is still a very active and up-to-date open source project with over 2300 companies contributing to the code and over 8300 people contributing to the code.

This makes Argo Workflows the most recognized workflow engine in the cloud native community.

Many organizations around the world have officially adopted and use Argo Workflows. This is a strong proof that Argo Workflows can solve the problems of real workloads even in the largest enterprises.

Some of the leading companies using Argo Workflows include.

![companys](./images/common/companys.png)

... and over 200 other global companies

Some alternative tools to Argo Workflows include Apache Airflow, Tekton, and Prefect.

Argo Workflows is a Kubernetes-native engine that makes it easy to orchestrate container-based workflows and manage resources. This is one of the key differences compared to similar tool Apache Airflow, which is a standalone application and does not inherently utilize the capabilities of Kubernetes. As a result, resource management and scalability can be more challenging with Airflow than with Argo Workflows.

Also, because Argo Workflows runs each workflow step as an independent container, it can perform a variety of tasks, such as CI/CD as well as data pipelines. This is possible by leveraging the power of Docker and Kubernetes, which allows you to run anything without restrictions.


## ☑️ Key Accomplishments

### UI/UX improvements

The Argo Workflows project is actively contributing to the topic, with UI/UX improvements as the main keyword for contributions, a separate project page, and issue tracking.

![uiux_0.png](./images/common/uiux_0.png)

Our team has also made many UI improvements along the lines of these project goals.

> Key improvements

- Workflows search functionality
- Improvements to the summary view of cronworkflows
- Improvements to DataPciker

### Improving core functionality

As members began to gain experience contributing, their understanding of the project grew, and as they gained confidence, they were increasingly able to contribute not only to UI/UX improvements, but also to the core functionality of the workflow engine.

[What’s new in Argo Workflows v3.5](https://blog.argoproj.io/whats-new-in-argo-workflows-v3-5-f260e8603ca6)

The core logic of the workflow engine is installed as a CRD in Kubernetes and has a significant impact on the behavior and performance of a Kubernetes cluster, making it a very high level contribution that requires a high level of implementation and active participation in testing and policy discussions with maintainers.

Despite the challenges, our team was able to make key contributions to the Argo Workflows 3.5 release, and our contributions to very important features such as Template Spec, Authentication, and Controller were mentioned on the Argo official blog.

![core_0](./images/common/core_0.png)

After the release of Argo Workflows 3.5, contributors continue to contribute to the CI and test environments for DX improvements, new features in the Nix, Controller, and Template specifications, and more challenging contributions such as updating the Go Lang version, and they are making meaningful contributions to the next release to make Argo Workflows an even better tool.

### Close communication with the maintainer group

Our team was very fortunate that the Argo Workflows project got a new leader in May of this year, Yuan Tang, and the breath of contributions across the project really accelerated.

Normally, in a large project like this, it would take quite a long time for reviews to take place, making it difficult to get a lot of contributions, but thanks to the talented project head and his team, all of the ArgoWorkflows team members who participated in this competition learned a lot, experienced a lot, and grew through a lot of contributions in a short time.

![maintainer.png](./images/common/maintainer.png)

As I've gotten closer to contributing to the core features of the workflow engine, there have been situations where I've been able to communicate and interact with maintainers on CNCF Slack beyond the PR page.

Through these discussions, I've been able to determine policies for handling logic in the project to resolve issues, and have been assigned other related issues to work on, giving me valuable experience in being a true part of an open source project.

Here are some of the contributions my team made during the project.

** Mutex check happens after memoization cache check and lock info missing from UI `Bug Fix` **

[Issue #11219](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/issues/11219)  
[PR #11456 - Merged/Included in 3.4.10 release](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/11456)

I managed to modify Argo Workflow to simultaneously utilize the Synchronization and Cache functionalities.

This bug manifested when using both the Synchronization and Memoize keywords in Argo Workflow, causing it not to operate correctly.

The expected behavior was for the Mutex Synchronization to function first followed by the cache, however, after Synchronization occurred, the cache failed to operate.

For instance, when there are `job-1` and `job-2`, if `job-1` operates first due to Mutex Synchronization and writes to the cache, `job-2` ** should pass without operating, courtesy of the shared cache.**

![slack11](./images/HaeMinSong/song_pr1_img.png)

I was able to fix this by adjusting the sequence of Synchronization and Cache.

While the fix was not complicated, modifying the `operation.go`, one of the intricate files, allowed me to explore various features of Argo Workflow with many reviews.

---

** Parent level memoization is broken `Bug Fix` **

[Issue #11612](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/issues/11612)  
[PR #11623 - Merged/Included in 3.4.11 release](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/11623)

A new bug arose from the above fix. When using the Memo function in child components rather than at the Template level in Argo Workflow, a bug was reported that caused infinite pending.

![slack11](./images/HaeMinSong/song_pr2_img.png)

I realized that there were unaddressed cases in the tests added in the previous PR. After identifying the cause of the error, I quickly patched it. I included four tests in the PR to detect such exceptions in the future.

---

** UI: workflowDrawer's information link is not correctly working `Bug Fix` **

[Issue #11494](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/issues/11494)  
[PR #11495 - Merged/Included in 3.4.10 release](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/11495)

I fixed an issue where the Information icon link was broken when expanding a workflow on the Argo Workflow dashboard.

![slack11](./images/HaeMinSong/song_pr3_img.png)

I introduced code to prevent incorrect event propagation caused by nested `<a>` tags. This correction ensured that clicking on the icon now directs users to the correct documentation.

---

** Search by name for WorkflowTemplates in UI `Feature Enhancement` **

[Issue #11004](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/issues/11004)  
[PR #11684 - Merged/Included in 3.4.10 release](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/11684)

This was a collaborative effort with two other contributors.

A helpful feature that allows templates in Argo Workflow to function through name patterns was missing.

![slack11](./images/HaeMinSong/song_pr4_img.png)

We developed an additional feature that lets users search for templates not just by Yaml labels, but also by names.
`The LIKE search, not just precise naming, will prove useful in the future.` Plans are underway to extend this search and pagination functionality to other pages, making this a particularly meaningful PR.

---

** Add more readable Argo CLI installation guide into github documentation `Documentation Contribution` **

[Issue #11750](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/issues/11750)  
[PR #11751 - Merged](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/11751)

This contribution pertains to the documentation of the Argo CLI, the command-line interface used with Argo Workflows.

![slack11](./images/HaeMinSong/song_pr5_img.png)

The current Argo CLI GitHub documentation lacked installation procedures, making it challenging for first-time users to determine how to install the Argo CLI.   Initially, users had to directly navigate to the Release Note or the Quick Start page.  
By adding an Installation section to the Argo CLI page alongside the existing Usage details, I aimed to enhance user convenience.

---

** Workflow templating is skipped when whitespace is added to template parameters `Bug Fix` **

[Issue #11767](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/issues/11767)  
[PR #11781 - Merged](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/11781)

In Argo Workflow, when authoring a workflow template, the placeholder in the form `{{parameter}}` did not undergo validation when spaces were added, such as `{{ parameter }}`.  
The root cause was the internal validation code not trimming spaces before and after the parameter. By adding the trim function to remove spaces, I resolved this issue. This contribution also rectified other placeholder content that previously bypassed validation.

** Contributing to the Argo Workflow OSS Common Repo **

[PR #22 - Merged](https://github.com/ArgoWorkflows-OSS/argoworkflows-oss.github.io/pull/22)

I undertook a preliminary exercise for multiple people to contribute to the Argo Workflow. We simultaneously modified new and existing documents with other participants, learning the importance of Git commands and the process of rebasing.

---

** Creating a Web Server with Dockerfile **

[PR #6 - Merged](https://github.com/ArgoWorkflows-OSS/container-playground/pull/6)

This exercise was about creating a Dockerfile that communicates with a local 8080 server and makes it accessible via localhost:8080.  
We simply crafted a Python server using Flask, and through the Dockerfile, we set up the environment, initiated the server, and connected the port, making the server accessible externally via Docker commands.

#### **🌵 Participation Review**

- Post-Participation Review
  - While I had participated in the open-source contribution academy before, I was especially satisfied with the program, members, and content of this academy.
  - It's not easy to understand the source code and start contributing in a short time, but it was an astonishing experience to be able to start contributing, even if it was a minor contribution.
  - I deeply felt that the concentrated care from the mentor and the passion of other participants were genuinely helpful.
  - Starting alone, I might have quickly given up and forgotten the content, but the experience was so different when progressing with others.
- Future Plans
  - I plan to continue contributing to Argo Workflow and may even start contributing to other open-source projects.
  - Especially now that I have learned how to approach and start with an open source I am interested in, I believe it will be a bit smoother as long as I have the passion.
  - I will actively promote the fun of contributing to open source to others and confidently recommend it.
